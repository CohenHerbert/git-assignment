# Project requires TWO functions:
# 1. rect_area (length, width) which will return the area of a rectangle
# 2. rect_solid_area (length, width, height) which will return the area of a solid rectangular object

def rect_area(x, y):
   area = x*y
   return area

# Request the dimension of a solid rectangular object
length = int(input("Enter the length of the the object as in integer: "))
width = int(input("Enter the width of the the object as in integer: "))

print(rect_area(length, width))

#end
